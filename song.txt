The ponies run, the girls are young
The odds are there to beat
You win a while, and then it's done
Your little winning streak

I'm turning tricks, I'm getting fixed
I'm back on boogie street
You lose your grip, and then you slip
Into the masterpiece

And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat
You live your life as if it's real
A thousand kisses deep

And maybe I had miles to drive
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive
A thousand kisses deep

and more
